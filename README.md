## #1 Initial Exploration: Cybersecurity

I am currently exploring different areas within computer engineering to decide my specialization.  
As a first step, I started with cybersecurity. 

I plan to continue improving this project until I finalize my decision about this area.  
Some of the upcoming enhancements include:

- Adding a password suggestion feature  
- Integrating online APIs to check for password breaches  
- Developing a graphical user interface (GUI)  
- Expanding the common password lists and improving performance  
- Exploring and integrating other cybersecurity tools and projects

# üîê Password Analyzer

This project is a small introduction to cybersecurity.  
It evaluates password strength based on the following criteria:

- Length  
- Use of uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Inclusion of digits  
- Presence of special characters  
- Whether the password appears in the top 10,000 most common passwords list  

The overall strength is calculated via a scoring system and explained to the user.

## Scoring System

| Criteria                      | Points    |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Length (8 or more characters) | +3        |
| Uppercase letter             | +1        |
| Lowercase letter             | +1        |
| Digit                       | +1        |
| Special character           | +1        |

### Strength Levels

- 0-4 points: Weak Security  
- 5-6 points: Medium Security  
- 7 points: Strong Security  

If the password is found in the top 10,000 common passwords list, it is always considered **Very Weak**.

### Example Output
<pre> 
Enter a password to check: Ilov3Coding!

Password length is sufficient (‚úì) 
Contains an uppercase letter (‚úì) 
Contains a lowercase letter (‚úì) 
Contains a digit (‚úì) 
Contains a special character (‚úì) 

Password strength :  Strong Security
